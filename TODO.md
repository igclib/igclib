## TODO

- take a look at [C++ strk](http://www.partow.net/programming/strtk/index.html)
- pugixml for xml parsing
- implement eager branching for straight line detection


## NOTES

- run 3 optimizations, or combine them in a single one for free, flat and FAI ?
- generate approximate solutions faster to tighten lower bound
